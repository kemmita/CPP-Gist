//normally when creating a method or class or function or vector we needed to declare the data type with templates that has changed
//with our method void print we are accepting a value that will be entered in the main function typically we would do void print(int n)
//but if we replace that with the template T, we can accept any data type, so instead of void print(int n) do void print(T n).

//like Python where n can take on the value of any data type. below we have assigned a int and string and both will be printed
	print(45);
